working with a blank display. Being SSD-based and passively cooled I could only
notice that the laptop seems to startup, and blinking some LEDs on the
motherboard.</p>
<p>Switching screen to other outputs did not improve the situation, confirming that
all outputs were affected. Removing RAM would change nothing but trigger the 3
bip error code when none was present, and same for the SSD. At least that would
confirm the processor was still alive and the problem might be limited to the
display.</p>
<p>Board inspection allowed to quickly find the source of the failure, a blown component, and an IC with several short circuits, labelled “6J=3F E27”. Searching on the internet for the failure and model name quickly lead to a series of videos [^1] showing similar repair attempts.</p>

<h2 id="searching-for-the-component">Searching for the component</h2>
<p>Finding the marking on Google did not return any result but an eBay search found references to a RT6220AGQUF voltage regulator [^2]. The datasheet gives us a matching package and pinout, which seems to confirm we found the correct chip. Furthher more we are not surprised that a component exposed to input voltage might fail.</p>
<p><img alt="RT6220 circuit diagram" src="RT6220-circuit-diagram.webp"/>{ style=”display: block; margin: 0 auto” }</p>
<p>Coupling this reference with our NUC6i7KYK model now allows us to find many more instances of this failure, confirming it is actually a recurrent issue on those boards. [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6] <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectronicsRepair/comments/1c5cuyi/is_this_buck_converter_faulty/">^7</a></p>
<p>The PIN position in the datasheet is off by 90 degrees, but allows us to confirm the inductor is upstream to the VIN pin of the chip, and the measurement on the top pin indeed shows a voltage of 19V, which is interrupted by the blown component. In addition, testing for the capacitors around reveal some shorted components which we might assume are caused by the IC.</p>
<p>According to the datasheet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Power input connect to high-side MOSFET drain. Place 2pcs 10uF MLCC decoupling capacitors near input pin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is likely the MOSFETs are responsible for the short and the IC caused the failure.  While we cannot be fully sure this is the only cause, and that no other components are damaged (eg. the CPU or GPU), we will try ordering and replacing both. We have at least a case of a successful repair in [^6], and comments in the video are suggesting some components values. Capacitors should be 10uF, 25V capacitors which matches the datasheet recommendation, and the additional (blown) component must be an inductor. There it is suggsted that any value will fit, and that we could even replace it by a 0 ohm resistor. We will avoid this last solution as such inductors are useful to filter current fluctuations and noise, and might help with impedance matching to better transfer power. </p>
<p>Lacking any reference value, we will use a 1uH as in the rest of the reference application circuit with 1V output. As for the package, measurement using a ruler seems to indicate that both inductors and capacitors are in 0805 package, which allows us to finalize our order for both components at a cost of a few euros online.</p>
<h2 id="repair">Repair</h2>
<p>Over the different documented repair attempts, it seems that at least one has been successful. We will be optimistic and assume that the fault is entirely related to the IC, and led to the inductor burning.</p>
<p>Order both on Aliexpress, much chepaer than ebay (a rati of 1-to-15):</p>
<ul>
<li>RT6220AG : 5.80€ (5pcs)</li>
<li>0805 induction 1uH : 1€37 (50 pcs)</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan is to desolder the inductor and the IC and confirm the shorts are gone, then proceed to the replacement, and pray for the best.</p>
<h2 id="attempt-1">Attempt 1</h2>
<p>Short seems solved
After 40s new short
Same component blows again</p>
<p>This time short persists after removing the two components like first time.</p>
<p>Following the power rails on the other side of the board, i can trace to a short
MOSFET : VCM 69</p>
<p>search for marking: WCM, package: SOT23
power MOSFET</p>
<p>once removed, still a short, 1 ohm, drawing 1 amp at reast when injecting

<p>nothing heats up</p>

      Setting up a development QEmu VM on Linux with nested virtualization for Windows 11 with WSL2
    </a>
  </h1>

<p>I exclusively run Linux at home, and needed a Windows VM for building the
<a href="https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball">virtual pinball suite</a>
and other software that required me to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL2).</p>
<h2 id="virtualbox-vs-qemu">Virtualbox vs QEmu</h2>
<p>I initially chose Virtualbox for simplicity but never managed to install WSL2 on
it. It appears that WSL2 is implemented on top of Windows HyperV technology, and
it thus requires nested virtualization features to be used inside a VM.</p>
<p>Unlike what is announced in official documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq#will-i-be-able-to-run-wsl-2-and-other-3rd-party-virtualization-tools-such-as-vmware--or-virtualbox-">wsl-virtualbox</a>, it seems
nested virtualization support for HyperV did not make it to the latest 7.0 Virtualbox
release (7.0.14-Debian as of this writing), and thus it was not possible to
install WSL2 <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=110039">vbox-hyperv</a>. This might change with the release of 7.1.</p>
<p><code>WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x80370102
Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.
For information please visit https://aka.ms/enablevirtualization</code></p>
<p>This is the opportunity to give a try at QEmu which supports it and promises to
be more efficient with the use of KVM and virtio.</p>
<h2 id="qemu-setup">QEmu setup</h2>
<p>I followed the excellent writeup by [raphtlw], for which the steps are equivalent
for Windows 11 (beyond a couple of remaining IDE occurrences that should be
SATA). The most important steps are summarized here and you can refer to
the original page for a detailed explanation with screenshots.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p>```
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm  bridge-utils virt-manager qemu-system virt-viewer spice-vdagent</p>
<p>```</p>
<h3 id="regular-setup">Regular setup</h3>
<p>Before starting the installation process, you will need to download two ISO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 11, available on [microsoft website][win11-download]</li>
<li><a href="virtio-iso">VirtoIO drivers ISO</a>, that will be needed to setup both virtio
devices which are required during installation (network is indeed mandatory),
and will be mounted as a second CDROM drive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a new VM that will be installed from a ISO file:</p>
<ul>
<li>’‘’CPU, memory’‘’ : I left default settings</li>
<li>’‘’disk size’‘’: At least 60GB is recommended as Windows itself will take
around 30GB, and build tools will require an additional 10/20 GB. You should always
be able to extend the partition after installation.</li>
<li>Create a second CDROM drive in the Storage menu (don’t forget to select the
  medium type to CDROM), and point to the downloaded ISO.</li>
<li>Enable boot from the SATA CDROM in Boot options. You should still be able to
select it via the BIOS menu if the machine does not boot.</li>
<li>Swtich to virtio driver in both the HDD and the NIC for improved performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fine-tuning-hyperv-support">Fine-tuning HyperV support</h3>
<p>The current setup worked fine until I installed WSL2 and rebooted and got
greeted with the infamous blue screen and the message:
SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, which it never managed to recover.</p>
<p>I found directions in this excellent <a href="https://www.redpill-linpro.com/techblog/2021/04/07/nested-virtualization-hyper-v-in-qemu-kvm.html">writeup from Redpill
Linpro</a>, and after a couple of tries with the XML editor in the
“Processor” section of the VM configuration, I managed to boot Windows again
with these settings:</p>
<p><code>xml
  &lt;features&gt;
    &lt;acpi/&gt;
    &lt;apic/&gt;
    &lt;pae/&gt;
    &lt;hyperv mode="custom"&gt;
      &lt;vpindex state="on"/&gt;
      &lt;synic state="on"/&gt;
    &lt;/hyperv&gt;
    &lt;smm state="on"/&gt;
  &lt;/features&gt;
  &lt;cpu mode="custom" match="exact" check="partial"&gt;
    &lt;model fallback="allow"&gt;Broadwell-noTSX-IBRS&lt;/model&gt;
    &lt;feature policy="disable" name="hypervisor"/&gt;
    &lt;feature policy="require" name="vmx"/&gt;
  &lt;/cpu&gt;
  &lt;clock offset="utc"&gt;
    &lt;timer name="rtc" tickpolicy="catchup"/&gt;
    &lt;timer name="pit" tickpolicy="delay"/&gt;
    &lt;timer name="hpet" present="no"/&gt;
    &lt;timer name="hypervclock" present="yes"/&gt;
    &lt;timer name="kvmclock" present="yes"/&gt;
  &lt;/clock&gt;</code></p>
<p>I did not try yet to optimize those settings beyond confirming disabling the CPU
passthrough and setting the correct CPU architecture were part of the solution.
The next step would be to dig more into the documentation and/or continue the
trial and error process to find which properties are indeed required, or lead to
the best performance, And as the article says, your results may vary…</p>
<p>As a reference, that was the original configuration proposed by QEmu.</p>
<p><code>xml
  &lt;features&gt;
    &lt;acpi/&gt;
    &lt;apic/&gt;
    &lt;hyperv&gt;

      &lt;vapic state="on"/&gt;
      &lt;spinlocks state="on" retries="8191"/&gt;
    &lt;/hyperv&gt;
    &lt;vmport state="off"/&gt;
  &lt;/features&gt;
  &lt;cpu mode="host-passthrough"/&gt;
  &lt;clock offset="localtime"&gt;

    &lt;timer name="pit" tickpolicy="delay"/&gt;
    &lt;timer name="hpet" present="no"/&gt;
    &lt;timer name="hypervclock" present="yes"/&gt;
  &lt;/clock&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="windows-11-installation">Windows 11 installation</h2>
<p>You can simply let the installer guide you until you reach the step where you
choose on which disk to install Windows, which should show an empty list.</p>
<p>You need to select the “Load drivers” option, and browse the second CDROM (E:)
to find the correct drivers for your OS and platform (note that sometimes there
is no win11 version but win10 is also fine):
- E:\viostor\w11\amd64 (for disk)
- E:\NetKVM\w11\amd64 (for NIC)
- E:\qxldod\w10\amd64 (for graphic card)</p>
<p>By checking “Hide drivers that are not compatible with this computer’s hardware”
you’ll ensure that the correct drivers are found. Nothing showing might be a
sign that you forgot for instance to switch a device to virtio.</p>
<p>Further down in the installation process, you won’t have the opportunity to load
new drivers through the GUI. You might reach a step where the installer tries to
find a network connection, and gets stuck because there is no network interface.
In such a situation, you can hit Shift+F10 to open a shell, navigate in the
respective folders, and run the following commands;</p>
<p><code>pnputil /add-driver *.inf
pnputil /scan-devices</code></p>
<p>It happened to me that the installer found the network interface but refused to
connect because of no internet connection. Running a ping from the shell
confirmed the issue. In the host, the packets arrived to the bridge but were not
forwarded, likely because of missing iptables rules. The simplest solution is
then to restart libvirtd, that will not affect running VMs:</p>
<p><code>sudo service libvirtd restart</code></p>
<h2 id="guest-agent-and-additional-drivers">Guest agent and additional drivers</h2>
<ul>
<li>E:\virtio-win-guest-tools.exe</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spice-space.org/download.html">spice-guest-tools</a>, in the Guest / Windows binaries section of the
page, to get advanced features such as copy/paste between the host and guest</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="visual-studio-and-related-tools">Visual Studio and related tools</h2>
<p>You can freely download the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">installer online</a> with the community edition.</p>
<p>These are the settings I used for my current use case, in the workloads tab.
They will approximately require 10 additional GB.</p>

<p>You can install WSL2 directly from the [Microsoft store][wsl-store], and it
seems you can also install a Distribution from there (eg Debian). We will go
through the steps to install it via commandline.</p>
<p>Choose cmd.exe in the start menu, and Run as administrator:</p>
<p><code>wsl --install</code></p>
<p>If you have Windows 11, or a recent enough version of windows 10, you should
already has WSL2. You can confirm with:</p>
<p><code>$ wsl -v
WSL version: 2.1.4.0

WSLg version: 1.0.60
MSRDC version: 1.2.5105

Windows version: 10.0.22631.2861</code></p>
<p>More information can be found in [wslinfo], [wsl1] and [wsl2]. The system will
ask you to reboot your machine.</p>
<p>You can then setup a Linux distribution (eg. Debian) through the following

<h2 id="maintainance">Maintainance</h2>
<p>If you even get out of disk space, you can either try to reclaim some space, or
extend the windows image files.</p>
<h3 id="reclaim-space-compact-os-virtual-memory-and-hibernation-files">Reclaim space: Compact OS, virtual memory and hibernation files</h3>
<p>You can first try to uninstall useless applications, although the setup we did
has hardly any software installed.</p>
<p>You can reclaim a few GB by compressing system files, following [this
tutorial][win10-footprint], which exploits the “Compact OS” feature of Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Start.</li>
<li>Search for Command Prompt, right-click the result, and select Run as administrator.</li>
<li>Type the following command to verify that your system is not already compressed and press Enter:Compact.exe /CompactOS:query</li>
<li>Type the following command to reduce the size of Windows 10 and apps and press Enter:Compact.exe /CompactOS:always</li>
<li>Once you completed these steps, Compact OS will begin the compression process, which could take up to 20 minutes.</li>
<li>You can always revert the changes using the same instructions, but on step No. 4, use this command Compact.exe /CompactOS:never and press Enter.</li>
</ul>
<p>A further way to gain space is to save on the virtual memory and hibernation
data files:</p>
<p>Open Start.
Search for Command Prompt, right-click the result, and select Run as administrator.
Type the following command to make Hiberfil.sys smaller and press Enter:powercfg /h /type reduced</p>
<p>The above command reduces the size of the hibernation file by 30 percent. If you want to remove the file completely, you can use the</p>
<p>powercfg /h /off
command instead.</p>
<p>If you want to change the hibernation settings back to the full amount, simply follow the same instructions, but on step No. 3, make sure to use this command</p>
<p>powercfg /h /size 100</p>
<h3 id="extending-the-qemu-image-size">Extending the QEMU image size</h3>
<p>Augment the qemu image size</p>
<p>While the host if down:</p>
<p><code>sudo qemu-img resize /var/lib/libvirt/images/win11.qcow2 +10G</code></p>
<p>You can then directly use Windows’ Disk Manager to extend the filesystem over
the newly available space.</p>
<p>I could not manage to move the other system partition sitting in between my C
drive and unallocated space.</p>
<p>sudo modprobe nbd max_part=16
sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0  /var/lib/libvirt/images/win11.qcow2</p>
<p>kde partition manager does not see the additional 10G
gparted does, but raises the following warning:
Not all of the space available to /dev/nbd0 appears to be used, you can fix the GPT to use all of the space (an extra 20971520 blocks) or continue with the current setting?</p>
<p>Once repaired it is okay in kde partition manager too.</p>
<p>sudo gparted /dev/nbd0</p>
<p>sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0</p>

      Replacing the spark plug of a Palazzetti Lara pellet stove
    </a>
  </h1>

<p>After a period with occasional startup hiccups, the pellet store suddenly
stopped switching on completely. After a quick confirmation that the spark plug
is the culprit, it is time to open it for a replacement.</p>
<p><img alt="Palazzetti Ecofire LARA" src="/blog/2024/Feb/palazzetti-spark-plug/palazzetti-ecofire-lara_m.jpg"/></p>
<h2 id="symptoms-and-quick-diagnostic">Symptoms and quick diagnostic</h2>
<p>Since a couple of monthes, my pellet stove started having startup issues,
despite its annual cleaning. By lack of a proper diagnostic, this continued to
happen from time to time until it suddenly stopped working completely despite
repeated attempts.</p>
<p>Since everything seemed to work correctly and the stove was correctly sucking
air from behind (while can be confirmed by putting a sheet of paper in front of
the intake pipe), the suspect was the spark plug.</p>
<p>A simple way to validate this assumption without opening it is to start it
normally (with door closed to avoid the security mechanism to trigger) and wait
like 5 minute until when it should have switched on in normal operations.
Without switching it off, we can then open the door, block pellet arrival
temporarity, remove the pellet tray and insert a small piece of paper inside the
spark plug compartment. Having no heat or burn mark confirmed the spark plug was
faulty and we had to replace it.</p>
<p>After a bit of online browsing, the announced duration of those elements seems
around 3 years, while had not been replaced in the last 7 years so this could be
considered as normal.</p>
<h2 id="opening-the-stove-and-confirmation">Opening the stove and confirmation</h2>
<p>Opening the stove is a simple procedure than can be performed in place. First
ensure that power is cut, before removing the top and side panel, and the back
grid. It is then easy to spot the spark plug which is inserted into the air
intake tube, and trace its connection back to the control board in the bottom
right side of the stove. You’ll have to cut a few zip ties, and unscrew the
control box and its protection to fully get the cable out.</p>
<p>With the manual we can confirm it position on the control board connector (being
a simple resistance, wires can be swapped). Testing it with the multimeter in
continuity mode shows no value, confirming it is time to replace it.</p>
<h2 id="selected-replacement-model">Selected replacement model</h2>
<p>With the stove model, it is easy to find online the characteristics of the spark
plug:</p>
<ul>
<li>power : 350W</li>
<li>total length : 170mm</li>
<li>total length under screw : 160mm</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue is that several model seem to correspond, and unless There are quite a few vendors</p>

<h2 id="first-tests">First tests:</h2>
<p>I did not find the information from the manual, but from online stores, we can find the power and length of the replacement model,
     but not the shape of its flange.
Correct one should be 160mm from the flange, as can be confirmed by inspected
the exisdting one.</p>

<p>Amazon, 1/2 to 1/3 of the price of other online vendors, and did not find a
comparative quality version, so i decided to give it a try. Delay was unbeatable
since it could arrive in the next morning, which is not negligible in the middle
of the winter season.</p>
<p>My choice was on this model:</p>
<p><img alt="Selected model" src="/blog/2024/Feb/palazzetti-spark-plug/spark-plug-amazon.png"/></p>
<p>New one:</p>
<ul>
<li>R = 150 Ohms</li>
<li>Expected : $R = \frac{U^2}{P} = 138 \Omega$ (good)</li>
<li>Actual power: $P = \frac{U^2}{R} = 322 W$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="replacement">Replacement</h2>
<p>Removing zip ties to untie the cable. Make a big detour in the stove towards
right then towards left. </p>
<p>Cable is shorter, lower section</p>
<p>Reuse the insulating element around the cable, after cutting it to length
More direct path to the control board, attached with zip ties, and replace those
which were cut.</p>
<p>The spark plug is held into place with one screw that we can access from the
right hand side.</p>
<p>Just a matter of unscrewing the wire on the connector to replace it and put
everything back into place.</p>
<p>THe stove starts again and the time to light it up is back to 3/4 minutes as it
used to be.</p>
