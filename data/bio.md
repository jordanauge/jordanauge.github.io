I am currently a researcher at {% manifold institution cisco %}, in the {%
manifold institution pirl %} , working in the Information Centric Networking
project, with a focus on mobile wireless networks. I am a member of {% manifold
institution systemx %}, working in the ARE project, through which I am
affiliated with the {% manifold institution lincs %} laboratory.

Since 2014, I hold a PhD from {% manifold institution tpt %} done jointly with
{% manifold institution orangelabs %}; my work is about the modeling and
evaluation of a flow-level traffic engineering proposal that breaks with
traditional approaches for QoS.

Previously, I have been a research assistant in the {% manifold institution cucl
%} of the {% manifold institution cambridge %} (2008-2009), a research engineer
at {% manifold institution upmc %}, affiliated with {% manifold institution lip6
%} and {% manifold institution lincs %} laboratories in Paris (2009-2014), and
finally a postdoc at {% manifold institution tpt %}, again with {% manifold
institution lincs %}.

I have received a diploma in Computer Science Engineering from {% manifold
institution ensiie %} in 2004.
