    abstract = {Information-Centric Networking (ICN) embraces a family of network architectures rethinking Internet communication principles around named-data. After several years of research and the emergence of a few popular proposals, the idea to replace the Internet protocol with data-centric networking remains a subject of debate. ICN advantages have been advocated in the context of 5G networks for the support of highly mobile, multi-access/source and latencyminimal patterns of communications. However, large scale testing and insertion in operational networks are yet to happen, likely due to the lack of a clear incremental deployment strategy. In this paper, we analyze a recent proposal Hybrid-ICN (hICN), an ICN integration inside IP (rather that over/ under/ in place of) that has the ambition to trade-off no ICN architectural principles. By reusing existing packet formats, hICN brings innovation inside the IP stack, requiring minimal software upgrades and guaranteeing transparent interconnection with existing IP networks. We describe the architecture and use the open source implementation to test hICN in the open Internet to validate its short-term deployability. Further, we consider linear video streaming over mobile wireless heterogeneous networks as use case to highlight hICN advantages compared to TCP/IP counterpart.}

A new trend of intent-based frameworks has emerged, where network administrators only input an abstract view of their desired network model instead of specifying the necessary steps to attain it. Intent-based networking holds the promise of autonomous, agile, and learning networks that configure themselves according to abstract policy without requiring human intervention. In this demonstration, we introduce a novel architecture for distributed intent-based network orchestration. For this purpose, we first extend the standard YANG to carry intent rather than configuration, adding missing features for in-network orchestration. Second, we use the model intents as network-native objects on which to perform routing and forwarding in-between orchestrators. Finally, we highlight the benefits of pushing intent in the network rather than fully processing it in a centralized orchestrator and illustrate potential improvements in term of scalability, programmability, and reliability.}

  abstract = {Mobility has become a basic premise of network communications, thereby requiring a native integration into 5G networks. Despite numerous efforts to propose and standardize effective mobility-management models for IP, the result is a complex, poorly flexible set of mechanisms. The natural support for mobility offered by ICN (Information Centric Networking) makes it a good candidate to define a radically new solution relieving limitations of the traditional approaches. If consumer mobility is supported in ICN by design, in virtue of its connectionless pull-based communication model, producer mobility is still an open challenge. In this work, we look at two prominent ICN architecture, CCN (Content Centric Networking) and NDN (Named Data Networking) and we propose MAP-Me, an anchor-less solution to manage micro-mobility of content producers via a name- based CCN/NDN data plane, with support for latency-sensitive streaming applications. We analyze MAP-Me performance and provide guarantees of correctness, stability, and bounded stretch, which we verify on real ISP topologies. Finally, we set up a comprehensive simulation environment in NDNSim 2.1 for MAP-Me evaluation and comparison with different classes of solution. We cover a wide range of topologies, mobility models and radio conditions, and conclude with a realistic trace-driven car-mobility pattern under a 802.11n radio access. The results are encouraging and highlight MAP-Me characteristics and efficiency in terms of user performance and network cost metrics. All the code is available as open-source.}

  abstract = {
    Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been proposed as an alternative to
    IP for future networks such as 5G. To speed up its development and adoption,
    researchers and engineers require testing tools that are both simple and
    scalable. In particular, it is crucial to be able to quickly deploy
    ICN-enabled network topologies in a flexible and efficient manner.

    In this demonstration, we showcase vICN (virtualized ICN), a platform that
    enables easy deployment, orchestration and management of ICN networks. vICN
    uses standard virtualization technologies such as Linux Containers (LXC) and
    is fully integrated with the CICN suite to enable flexible testing of ICN
    technologies on general-purpose hardware. Furthermore, it can perform live
    monitoring and modification of the network. In particular, we use vICN to
    deploy a simple topology that consists of 9 nodes. We show that vICN
    bootstraps the topology in about 60s on commodity hardware.
    We then demonstrate how vICN interacts with the virtualized network and how
    it can be used for easy experimentation.

  abstract = {
    One of the fundamental requirements of next generation 5G networks is the
    support for seamless mobility over an heterogeneous access network by
    design. The shift from host-based to content-based location-independent
    communication makes Information-Centric Networking (ICN) an appealing
    technology to provide not only mobility, but security and storage as native
    properties of the network architecture.

    Previous work in ICN literature has focused on name-based mobility
    management solutions and particularly on the challenges of producer
    mobility, which involves an interaction between forwarding and control
    plane.

    In this paper, we consider the security implications of producer mobility in
    ICN and highlight the importance of securing producer to network
    interactions to avoid any sort of cyber attack potentially leading to denial
    of service. To this aim, we propose a fully distributed and very
    low-overhead protocol for name prefix attestation in the network based on
    hash-chaining. First results show a significant improvement in verification
    latency of order of magnitudes with respect to signature verification.

    Mobile video delivery drives Internet traffic evolution and puts
    colossal pressure on future 5G networks to support higher quality and lower
    latency requirements over an increasingly heterogeneous network access. Future
    Internet paradigms recentering communication around content, such as
    Information Centric Networks (ICN), appear as promising candidates to relieve
    the challenges of a mobility-robust, efficient and cost-effective video
    delivery, by integrating video-awareness at network layer. In this demo, we
    focus on ICN-enabled Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DAS) over an heterogeneous
    wireless access. We integrate ICN capabilities in DAS clients requesting 4K
    video content to standard DAS servers. We deploy a virtualized ICN-enabled
    network slice using LXC containers to connect clients to servers through an
    heterogeneous wireless access (802.11n and LTE emulated radios) and a
    simplified backhaul.

    The contribution of the demo is twofold.  First it showcases what ICN can
    bring to DAS over a mobile heterogeneous access in virtue of its
    content-awareness at network layer. Second, it offers to the user a rich
    sandbox where several state-of-the-art DAS controllers are implemented and
    can be tested over ICN or standard TCP.

  abstract = {
    To assess the feasibility and potential for deployment of new networking
    paradigms such as ICN, being able to carry out large scale experimentation
    and tests in real operational networks is crucial. Various platforms have
    been developed by the research community to support design and evaluation of
    specific aspects of ICN architecture. Most of them provide ICN-dedicated,
    small scale or application-specific environments and ad-hoc testing tools,
    non reusable in other contexts nor in real-world IP deployments.

    The goal of this paper is to contribute vICN (virtualized ICN), a unified
    open-source framework for network configuration and management that uses
    recent progresses in resource isolation and virtualization techniques. It
    offers a single, flexible and scalable platform to serve different purposes,
    ranging from reproducible large-scale research experimentation, to
    demonstrations with  emulated and/or physical devices and network resources
    and to real deployments of ICN in existing IP networks. In the paper, we
    describe the rationale for vICN and its components, highlighting
    programmability, scalability and reliability as its core principles.
    Illustration of vICN properties is provided through concrete examples.

    different to that of previous work on MBAC in that there is no prior

    maintain adequate throughput for elastic flows and to ensure low packet
    latency for any flow whose peak rate is less than a given threshold. In the
    paper we consider the second objective assuming realistically that most
    elastic and streaming flows are rate limited. We propose an MBAC algorithm
    and evaluate its performance by simulation under different stationary
    traffic mixes and in a flash crowd scenario. The algorithm is shown to offer
    a satisfactory compromise between flow performance and link utilization.},
