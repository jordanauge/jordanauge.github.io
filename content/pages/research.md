## Short bio

Since 2014, I am affiliated with Cisco Systems France, where I am currently a
Tech lead within the Outshift innovation arm. The mission of the organization is
both to research new technologies, and bring them to life as part as the company
portfolio.

My current research activity is related to system and network security. We are
developing solutions for real-time threat detection in the cloud and
cloud-native environments, based on results from threat modelling, knowledge
graph representations, and applications of AI/ML (graph embeddings and
classification) and Generative AI.

You can see applications of our research in the CDR (Cloud Detection & Response)
part of the [Panoptica](http://panoptica.app) product.

## PhD

My PhD thesis fits in the Flow-Aware Networking proposal proposed by Jim Roberts
around 2004, resulting for years of research on network performance modelling.
It was a CIFRE thesis done jointly with Telecom ParisTech under the direction of
Daniel Kofman, and Orange Labs under the direction of James Roberts.

More specifically, I have been working on a realization of such architecture in
a Linux software router, Cross-Protect, and analyzed performance issues related to this
realization: buffer sizing, flow-level implicit admission control, and
interaction of fair queueing and transport protocols. Finally, I considered a
declination of this flow-aware architecture in the access network.
