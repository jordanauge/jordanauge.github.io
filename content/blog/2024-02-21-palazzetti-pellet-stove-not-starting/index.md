After a period with occasional startup hiccups, the pellet store suddenly
stopped switching on completely. After a quick confirmation that the spark plug
is the culprit, it is time to open it for a replacement.

## Symptoms and quick diagnostic

Since a couple of monthes, my pellet stove started having startup issues,
despite its annual cleaning. By lack of a proper diagnostic, this continued to
happen from time to time until it suddenly stopped working completely despite
repeated attempts.

Since everything seemed to work correctly and the stove was correctly sucking
air from behind (while can be confirmed by putting a sheet of paper in front of
the intake pipe), the suspect was the spark plug.

A simple way to validate this assumption without opening it is to start it
normally (with door closed to avoid the security mechanism to trigger) and wait
like 5 minute until when it should have switched on in normal operations.
Without switching it off, we can then open the door, block pellet arrival
temporarity, remove the pellet tray and insert a small piece of paper inside the
spark plug compartment. Having no heat or burn mark confirmed the spark plug was
faulty and we had to replace it.

After a bit of online browsing, the announced duration of those elements seems
around 3 years, while had not been replaced in the last 7 years so this could be
considered as normal.

## Opening the stove and confirmation

Opening the stove is a simple procedure than can be performed in place. First
ensure that power is cut, before removing the top and side panel, and the back
grid. It is then easy to spot the spark plug which is inserted into the air
intake tube, and trace its connection back to the control board in the bottom
right side of the stove. You'll have to cut a few zip ties, and unscrew the
control box and its protection to fully get the cable out.

With the manual we can confirm it position on the control board connector (being
a simple resistance, wires can be swapped). Testing it with the multimeter in
continuity mode shows no value, confirming it is time to replace it.

## Selected replacement model

With the stove model, it is easy to find online the characteristics of the spark
plug:

 - power : 350W
 - total length : 170mm
 - total length under screw : 160mm

The issue is that several model seem to correspond, and unless There are quite a few vendors

## First tests:

I did not find the information from the manual, but from online stores, we can find the power and length of the replacement model,
     but not the shape of its flange.
Correct one should be 160mm from the flange, as can be confirmed by inspected
the exisdting one.

Puissance : 350 W
Longueur totale : 170 mm
Longueur sous écrou : 160 mm

Amazon, 1/2 to 1/3 of the price of other online vendors, and did not find a
comparative quality version, so i decided to give it a try. Delay was unbeatable
since it could arrive in the next morning, which is not negligible in the middle
of the winter season.

My choice was on this model:

New one:

- R = 150 Ohms
- Expected : $R = \frac{U^2}{P} = 138 \Omega$ (good)
- Actual power: $P = \frac{U^2}{R} = 322 W$

## Replacement

Removing zip ties to untie the cable. Make a big detour in the stove towards
right then towards left. 

Cable is shorter, lower section

Reuse the insulating element around the cable, after cutting it to length
More direct path to the control board, attached with zip ties, and replace those
which were cut.

The spark plug is held into place with one screw that we can access from the
right hand side.

Just a matter of unscrewing the wire on the connector to replace it and put
everything back into place.

THe stove starts again and the time to light it up is back to 3/4 minutes as it
used to be.
