We challenge a set of common assumptions that are frequently used to model
interdomain routing in the Internet. We draw assumptions from the scientific
literature and confront them with routing decisions that are actually taken by
ASes, as seen in BGP feeds. We show that the assumptions are too simple to model
real-world Internet routing policies. We also show that ASes frequently route in
ways that are inconsistent with simple economic models of AS relationships. Our
results should introduce a note of caution into future work that makes these
assumptions and should prompt attempts to find more accurate models.
