The future landscape of a heterogeneous and unified access (WiFi and Cellular),
where users and applications interact with heterogeneous multi-cloud networks, with
many different services collaborating together, poses significant challenges to ISP,
Enterprises, Cloud Providers and the applications themselves, in particular in terms
of Policies, Security and QoE.

In this demonstration we showcase the potential of Hybrid ICN (hICN) in the context
of enforcing inter-domain policies: exploiting the connection-less, app-aware,
multipoint transport of hICN we are able to manage policies on a per-application
basis, combining multiple objectives of different players (ISP, Enterprise, Users)
in a dynamic and seamless manner.
