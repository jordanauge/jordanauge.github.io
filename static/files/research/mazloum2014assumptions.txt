We challenge a set of assumptions that are frequently used to model interdomain
routing in the Internet by confronting them with routing decisions that are
actually taken by ASes, as revealed through publicly available BGP feeds. Our
results quantify for the first time the extent to which such assumptions are too
simple to model real-world Internet routing policies. This should introduce a
note of caution into future work that makes these assumptions and should prompt
attempts to find more accurate models.
