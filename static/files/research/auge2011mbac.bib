    abstract={It has previously been shown that the combined use of fair queuing
    and admission control would allow the Internet to provide satisfactory
    quality of service for both streaming and elastic flows without explicitly
    identifying traffic classes. In this paper we discuss the design of the
    required measurement based admission control (MBAC) scheme. The context is
    different to that of previous work on MBAC in that there is no prior
    knowledge of flow characteristics and there is a twofold objective: to
    maintain adequate throughput for elastic flows and to ensure low packet
    latency for any flow whose peak rate is less than a given threshold. In the
    paper we consider the second objective assuming realistically that most
    elastic and streaming flows are rate limited. We propose an MBAC algorithm
    and evaluate its performance by simulation under different stationary
    traffic mixes and in a flash crowd scenario. The algorithm is shown to offer
    a satisfactory compromise between flow performance and link utilization.}
