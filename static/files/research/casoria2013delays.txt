Hosts in the current Internet are seldom experiencing large queueing delays,
dubbed bufferbloat, that are self-inflicted by users due to TCP dynamics filling
their access link buffers. While it is known that maximum bufferbloat possibly
grows up to a few seconds, it is less understood how often in practice these
delays may affect the user Internet experience. To answer this question, we
design a system based on distributed agents running on PlanetLab that aims at
quantify- ing its extent. Specifically, we focus on continously probing, at a
higher frequency than typically done today, a fairly large number of hosts, to
build a spatial and temporal map of Internet bufferbloat. In this paper, we
report on the system architecture, its validation, and a preliminary results of
a measurement campaign we are currently running.
