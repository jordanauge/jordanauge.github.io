Network management systems have undergone tremendous changes to adapt to the
growing complexity and diversity of network deployments. A new trend of
intent-based frameworks has emerged, where network administrators only input an
abstract view of their desired network model instead of specifying the necessary
steps to attain it. Intent-based networking holds the promise of autonomous,
agile, and learning networks that configure themselves according to abstract
policy without requiring human intervention.

In this demonstration, we introduce a novel architecture for distributed
intent-based network orchestration. For this purpose, we first extend the
standard YANG to carry intent rather than configuration, adding missing features
for in-network orchestration. Second, we use the model intents as network-native
objects on which to perform routing and forwarding in-between orchestrators.
Finally, we highlight the benefits of pushing intent in the network rather than
fully processing it in a centralized orchestrator and illustrate potential
improvements in term of scalability, programmability, and reliability.
