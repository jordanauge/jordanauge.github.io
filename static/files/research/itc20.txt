The issue of buffer sizing is rightly receiving increasing attention with the
realization that the bandwidth delay product rule-of-thumb is becoming
unsustainable as link capacity continues to grow. In the present paper we
examine this issue from the light of our understanding of traffic
characteristics and the performance of statistical bandwidth sharing. We
demonstrate through simple analytical models coupled with the results of ns2
simulations that, while a buffer equivalent to the bandwidth delay product is
certainly unnecessary, the recently advocated reduction to a few dozen packets
is too drastic. The required buffer size depends significantly on the peak
exogenous rate of multiplexed flows.
