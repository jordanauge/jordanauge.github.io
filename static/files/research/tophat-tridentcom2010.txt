Researchers use the PlanetLab testbed for its ability to host experimental
applications in realistic conditions over the public best-effort internet. Such
applications form overlays whose performance is affected by the underlying
topology and its evolution. While several topology information services have
been proposed for PlanetLab, the TopHat system that we describe here fills a
special niche. It is designed to support the entire lifecycle of an experiment:
from setup, through run time, to retrospective analysis. TopHat does so in a new
way, by drawing upon excellent, proven third party services, notably the Dimes
and Etomic measurement infrastructures, for specialized measurements. TopHat has
been developed as the active measurement component of PlanetLab Europe, the
flagship testbed of the OneLab experimental facility. It is part of OneLabâ€™s
larger effort to pioneer the federation of previously independent testbeds and
measurement systems in order to provide a diverse global scale environment for
Future Internet research.
